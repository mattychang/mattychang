## About me

I am an research assistant in Berkley Gryder's lab at Case Western Reserve University. I currently work in the space of chemical biology, epigenetics, and drug discovery. I am interested in (1) identifying targetable vulnerabilities using molecular and genomic techniques, and (2) developing new chemical tools to modulate oncogenic mechanisms.

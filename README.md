## About me

I am an undergraduate student studying Chemsitry and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University. I currently do cancer epigenomics research with Berkley Gryder, PhD. I am interested in bioinformatics, functional genomics, and drug development. During my free time, I also enjoy climbing, hiking, and cooking.

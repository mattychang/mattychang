## About me

I am an undergraduate student studying Chemsitry and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University. I currently do chemical epigenomics and cancer biology research with Berkley Gryder. I am interested in drug discovery, next-generation sequencing, as well as genetic and chemical screening. During my free time, I also enjoy climbing, hiking, and cooking.
